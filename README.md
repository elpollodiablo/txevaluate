# txevaluate
A small python module for evaluating logic expressions in twisted

With txevaluate you can lazily evaluate simple logic expressions. It's main use (for me) is to create quick, easy and efficient granular access controls that can even be loaded from config files (with yaml) and do not repeat boilerplate logic code.
